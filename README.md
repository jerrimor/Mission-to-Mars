# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to allow for practice utilizing web scraping methods to create a web page. Beautiful soup, python, splinter and CSS styling was utilized for the scraping process and to build and style the web page.   The topic is Mars and the reason for the site is to illustrate the informational facts and images scraped from a few different sites to have an insightful and clean web page about Mars.  The site should be well laid out and show both Mars facts and images so that potentially, this individual can get NASA to see their knowledge and skills.  

## Project Summary
Web scraping was successful and the data is returned to build a facts table.  The scraping also successfully returns images for the web page. Mars enthusiasts can see the latest articles on Mars and the most recent images of Mars, on this web site.  

## Project Results 
The web site has full images of Mars and its hemispheres.  The page also shares Mars facts and compares them with facts from Earth.  A button is on the site to allow the user to initiate a new scrape so that the most recent information, such as articles on Mars are reflected on the site.
